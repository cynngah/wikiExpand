# wikiExpand
Chrome extension to expand wikipedia links with an abstract blurb

Wikipedia is probably one of the most used sources of information people use to learn from nowadays. Sometimes we just want to know roughly what something is while we're reading something. WikiExpand allows you to read the abstract information of a Wikipedia link and get on with reading whatever you were reading without being distracted by having to open an alternate tab and googling things.
